# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-ML-vs-DL
This project compares traditional Machine Learning techniques and Deep Learning models for brain tumor detection using MRI images. It highlights performance differences between classical algorithms (like SVM, Random Forest) and CNN-based deep learning architectures in terms of accuracy, training time, and feature extraction.
